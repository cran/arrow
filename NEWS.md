# arrow 0.16.0

## Multi-file datasets

This release includes a `dplyr` interface to Arrow Datasets,
which let you work efficiently with large, multi-file datasets as a single entity.
Explore a directory of data files with `open_dataset()` and then use `dplyr` methods to `select()`, `filter()`, etc. Work will be done where possible in Arrow memory. When necessary, data is pulled into R for further computation. `dplyr` methods are conditionally loaded if you have `dplyr` available; it is not a hard dependency.

See `vignette("dataset", package = "arrow")` for details.

## Linux installation

A source package installation (as from CRAN) will now handle its C++ dependencies automatically.
For common Linux distributions and versions, installation will retrieve a prebuilt static
C++ library for inclusion in the package; where this binary is not available,
the package executes a bundled script that should build the Arrow C++ library with
no system dependencies beyond what R requires.

See `vignette("install", package = "arrow")` for details.

## Data exploration

* `Table`s and `RecordBatch`es also have `dplyr` methods.
* For exploration without `dplyr`, `[` methods for Tables, RecordBatches, Arrays, and ChunkedArrays now support natural row extraction operations. These use the C++ `Filter`, `Slice`, and `Take` methods for efficient access, depending on the type of selection vector.
* An experimental, lazily evaluated `array_expression` class has also been added, enabling among other things the ability to filter a Table with some function of Arrays, such as `arrow_table[arrow_table$var1 > 5, ]` without having to pull everything into R first.

## Compression

* `write_parquet()` now supports compression
* `codec_is_available()` returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` whether the Arrow C++ library was built with support for a given compression library (e.g. gzip, lz4, snappy)
* Windows builds now include support for zstd and lz4 compression (#5814, @gnguy)

## Other fixes and improvements

* Arrow null type is now supported
* Factor types are now preserved in round trip through Parquet format (#6135, @yutannihilation)
* Reading an Arrow dictionary type coerces dictionary values to `character` (as R `factor` levels are required to be) instead of raising an error
* Many improvements to Parquet function documentation (@karldw, @khughitt)

# arrow 0.15.1

* This patch release includes bugfixes in the C++ library around dictionary types and Parquet reading.

# arrow 0.15.0

## Breaking changes

* The R6 classes that wrap the C++ classes are now documented and exported and have been renamed to be more R-friendly. Users of the high-level R interface in this package are not affected. Those who want to interact with the Arrow C++ API more directly should work with these objects and methods. As part of this change, many functions that instantiated these R6 objects have been removed in favor of `Class$create()` methods. Notably, `arrow::array()` and `arrow::table()` have been removed in favor of `Array$create()` and `Table$create()`, eliminating the package startup message about masking `base` functions. For more information, see the new `vignette("arrow")`.
* Due to a subtle change in the Arrow message format, data written by the 0.15 version libraries may not be readable by older versions. If you need to send data to a process that uses an older version of Arrow (for example, an Apache Spark server that hasn't yet updated to Arrow 0.15), you can set the environment variable `ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT=1`.
* The `as_tibble` argument in the `read_*()` functions has been renamed to `as_data_frame` ([ARROW-6337](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6337), @jameslamb)
* The `arrow::Column` class has been removed, as it was removed from the C++ library

## New features

* `Table` and `RecordBatch` objects have S3 methods that enable you to work with them more like `data.frame`s. Extract columns, subset, and so on. See `?Table` and `?RecordBatch` for examples.
* Initial implementation of bindings for the C++ File System API. ([ARROW-6348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6348))
* Compressed streams are now supported on Windows ([ARROW-6360](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6360)), and you can also specify a compression level ([ARROW-6533](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6533))

## Other upgrades

* Parquet file reading is much, much faster, thanks to improvements in the Arrow C++ library.
* `read_csv_arrow()` supports more parsing options, including `col_names`, `na`, `quoted_na`, and `skip`
* `read_parquet()` and `read_feather()` can ingest data from a `raw` vector ([ARROW-6278](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6278))
* File readers now properly handle paths that need expanding, such as `~/file.parquet` ([ARROW-6323](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6323))
* Improved support for creating types in a schema: the types' printed names (e.g. "double") are guaranteed to be valid to use in instantiating a schema (e.g. `double()`), and time types can be created with human-friendly resolution strings ("ms", "s", etc.). ([ARROW-6338](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6338), [ARROW-6364](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-6364))
